The googlebook module is a filter module and an API for the
http://books.google.com, that allows a user to insert rich Google Book data
into nodes via filters with data retrieved from http://books.google.com.
The user of this filter module will be able to easily insert:

1. book data from Google into pages using Drupal filters,
2. a book cover image when it exists,
3. there are options to include / exclude any data fields,
4. and for books with a full or partial preview,
   the Google book reader for the volume.

The starting framework of the code was based on the Book Post module to get ideas which gets data from Open Library instead of the Google Books API although little remains of that module other than the framework. The googlebook module API is different based on the data returned as well as the final aims of the module, although they do both return book data.

The Google Book search can be done with many types of search strings.

There are many search options with Google books and many options to display that data within the Google Book module. The API pulls data from Google Books in a generic way.
